# Amateur Radio Station Documentation Project (ARSDP)

## Why Does the ARSDP Exist?
Amateur Radio Stations can be as simple as a handheld unit, or a complex as a multi-tower, multi-antenna, multi-transceiver, multi-mode, multi-operator setup. In short, they can be as simple or as complex as we want them to be. But whether they are simple or complex, a system to document the station can be good to have. That is the goal of this project.

This project will, hopefully, allow you to document more than just how your station is setup. For example, here in the U.S. the Federal Communications Commision (FCC) has updated Radio Frequency Exposure rules that went into effect on 03/05/2021. These new rules remove the former categorical exemption for amateur radio stations to perform an RFE Evaluation, now each license holder must determine whether or not they are exempt and if not, they need to perform an evaluation. This document can help you to document whether or not you need to perform an evaluation, and document the evaluation if it is necessary.

A complex station owner may want to document how they have things setup. What equipment they have, what is connected to what, etc. This project will allow you to do that as well.

These are just a couple of quick examples of how this project can help you. Whether or not you choose to use this project is entirely up to you.

## How to Use the ARDSP
The ARDSP consists of a single word processor document, in DOC format. While DOC is a Microsoft Word format, and Word is the most popular word processor available, most, if not all, word processors can handle DOC format documents, allowing you to edit them in whatever word processor you prefer.

The document contains several sections and pages, each of which provides instructions on how to use that particular section. But, don't feel as though you need to conform to what we have in the document. You can use it as a guide to help you document your station your way. This is just a tool to help you.

## Contributing to ARDSP
If you have ideas for new sections, or imporvements to existing sections, please feel free to let me know. I welcome your help with this project. Just go to the issues page and open a new issue.

I hope that you find ARDSP useful.
